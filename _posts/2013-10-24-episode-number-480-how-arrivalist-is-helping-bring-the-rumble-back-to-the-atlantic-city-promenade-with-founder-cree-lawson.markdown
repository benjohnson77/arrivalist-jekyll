**Episode #480**

Location based marketing and mobile marketing are on the top of everyone’s to do list for their organizations – probably yours as well. The challenge with anything to do with mobile is to understand where to start. The possibilities seem endless and so so lucrative however the first step seems steep and distant.

There could be many reasons for this: Cost, technology, commitment, human behaviour or fear among many others. So how did a tourist city in New Jersey – Atlantic City – come to the decision to bring location marketing into their mix and go on to achieve such great results that they are upping their bet in the coming year?

Enter Arrivalist and founder Cree Lawson. At the core of what they do is to help places understand what marketing initiatives drove people from their couches, cities, states or countries to them. Something Cree calls attribution analytics. Their technology and the concepts behind it are fascinating and simple but demonstrably effective and that’s what we talk about in this episode.

It has taken Arrivalist 3 years to “arrive” and the results they are getting for their customers are starting to turn heads, open wallets and, more importantly, make mobile, location and contextual marketing easy to understand and implement.

*Come back next week to hear from Dave Roesch, Director of Marketing for the Atlantic City Convention & Visitors Authority (ACCVA) – the guys that hired Cree and his team to do all of this. You can sign up for the mailing list to receive notification when that episode goes live.*

Enjoy!
