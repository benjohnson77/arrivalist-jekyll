<p>“We measure the way media moves us,” is how Cree Lawson, the soft-spoken founder and CEO of mobile measurement company, Arrivalist, which focuses on providing marketing services to DMOs (Destination Marketing Organizations), describes his company. While there’s some poetry and marketing speak to his description, Lawson also means it literally– as in how do you measure the impact of advertising that seeks to literally convince you to move from one location to another. It’s no small task with big dollars at stake</p>

<p>“America spends $855 billion on the ground, in-destination while traveling. Compare that to the less than $150 billion Americans spend on flights and hotels before they reach the market,” says Lawson of the marketing dollars and economic activity surrounding the destination marketing. And that’s just in the U.S. “We want to make it easier for marketers to connect people with places and to make marketing more of an invitation and less like an ad. We feel we can build insights and predictive analytics on the way people travel and the impact that has on local economies,” continues Lawson.</p>

<p>Arrivalist provides patent-pending marketing technology that anonymously measures changes in a user’s location via their mobile devices after various types of media exposure. They triangulate advertising exposure with location-aware digital devices to provide the first true measurement of destination advertising ROI.</p>

<p>The company is still very much in its formative stage. “We started the company in 2010, tested our technology in 2011, have our patent pending in 2012 and formally launched in January of 2013 and this year is all about scaling the business,” says Lawson. The company’s first market is destinations, including tourism bureaus at its core, but it also plans to expand its offering to include university marketing, real estate, conferences and meetings, sporting events and golf package marketers.</p>

<p>The real ‘aha’ moment was the realization that the market was literally right in our hands (meaning our mobile devices). “We came up with the notion that the location of your mobile device is a proxy for response to digital advertising,” says Lawson. The company develops what they call an LED (Location, Exposure, Device) profile by using log-in information across devices to formulate a general picture of the user.</p>

<p>“We have two patent applications. One for measuring change in location after ad exposure and another for the delivery of the Connected Traveler ads,” says Lawson of the opportunity to both measure ad impact and to deliver marketing messages to users who are in the midst of their travels.</p>

<p>“We feel we have a strong first-mover advantage,” says Lawson, but the company is still very much in the formative stage. It has 3 full time employees and an array of part-time developers and engineers. “We have our angel investor, but mostly I have funded the technology and patents myself,” continues Lawson.</p>

<p>The company’s first launch partner was the Atlantic City Conventions and Visitors Authority. This was after the Sandy storm devastation to the Jersey coast. Many people thought Atlantic City had disappeared and visits began to drop to historic lows from the 29 million visitors in 2011. Arrivalist helped the ACCVA measure the impact of their digital advertising and now the organization has the data to prove the value of its investments and to even request additional funding as a result.</p>

<p>Lawson knows a lot about travel and math, so his journey to founding Arrivalist seems pre-ordained. “I grew up in Nashville, Tennessee. My father was a math teacher and my mom a psychology teacher—so analytics was in my blood. I grew up seeing the country from the back seat of my folks’ station wagon. I’ve been to 49 out of 50 states” (he won’t visit North Dakota until they sign up for Arrivalist), jokes Lawson.</p>

<p>Prior to Arrivalist, Lawson started Travel Ad Network (TAN)–one of the leading Vertical Ad Networks–with less than $500,000 in investment and turned it into the largest travel information audience in the world. Before Travel Ad Network, Lawson served in a variety of Management, Sales, Business Development and Marketing roles at Random House, the Associated Press, Gannett, Time Warner Trade Publisher and two Internet start-ups. He’s also a nationally-recognized investigative reporter and an academic All-American athlete. His publishing career began in 1994 when, as editor of the college newspaper, he made the Belmont Vision one of the first 5 college papers published online.</p>

<p>“Tourism and destination marketers are my heroes. It’s the toughest marketing challenge there is to convince someone to go from one location to another. We have an opportunity to help tourism take its rightful place at the center of economic development and provide tourism marketers with a clear measurement of their digital advertising investments,” concludes Lawson.</p>
