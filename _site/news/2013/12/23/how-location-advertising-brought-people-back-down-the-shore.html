				</h3>
				<p>
					<p>After Hurricane Sandy struck the Atlantic Coast in the fall of 2012, New Jersey’s Atlantic City saw both a significant number of tourists canceling plans to visit town as well as a drop-off in new bookings.</p>

<p>However, unlike other beach towns that were ravaged by Sandy, the perception was worse than the reality in Atlantic City. “They had more of a storm of publicity than the storm that hit them,” said Arrivalist Founder-CEO Cree Lawson. So to bring visitors back to the shore, the Atlantic City Convention &amp; Visitors Authority (ACCVA) partnered with the analytics and attribution technology company to make Atlantic City’s advertising more effective.</p>

<p>Arrivalist, founded in 2010 by Lawson, who founded Travel Ad Network prior to that, tracks changes in a user’s location to measure the efficacy of ads, monitoring the change in a device’s location to indicate a user’s change in market. “While everyone else is focused on delivering ads to a street corner, we’re focused on devices moving from city to city,” explains Lawson.</p>

<p>He refers to destination marketing as “the land that time forgot,” as advertisers would buy ads without knowing whether anyone actually showed up as a response to their messaging. In the case of Atlantic City, where the majority of visitors arrive by bus, it is especially difficult to track consumer behavior other than by tracking location change. So “for a tourism board to be able to measure a chance in location in response to an ad … that is the Holy Grail,” said Lawson.</p>

<p>Working with Arrivalist, the ACCVA was able to ascertain that certain media exposures drove a lot more visitors than others. For example, the ACCVA had been sending promotional emails and putting deals on its website in early spring. Arrivalist found that people who received email messaging were, on average, arriving to Atlantic City 45 days after exposure, while people who saw deals online were arriving 30 days after seeing them. The ACCVA changed its plan from email messaging to focus on mobile and retargeted banner ads, and Arrivalist found that 7,000 people showed up in two weeks after seeing the banner ads. Since the beginning of the campaign, 75,000 visitors have arrived after being exposed to the tourism board’s media, according to Lawson. The data also helped the ACCVA determine which ads were better suited to consumers based on where in the U.S. they were arriving from, thus allowing it to build out certain approaches for different markets.</p>

<p>While Arrivalist used apps early on to deliver ads to people first arriving to Atlantic City, it found that travelers are far more likely to interact with the mobile web. It also found that people are more likely to respond to ads placed on non-travel planning websites, as people use their mobile devices to visit sport sites, games, etc. while away from home. “Connected traveler” ads with discount offers that appeared on a mobile device 1/2 mile from a destination were highly effective. For example, a $5 off Ripley’s Believe It or Not coupon that appeared on devices 1/2 mile from the site had a 2% click-through rate, and an ad for the Atlantic City Aquarium had a 4% click-through rate.</p>

<p>Delivering relevant offers based on location has led to great success in mobile advertising, but Lawson acknowledges that “this is a marathon, not a sprint.” With so much to weed out from having inaccurate location information, the industry is “a long way away from accuracy.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, location is making great strides and Atlantic City’s great bounce-back story is just one example of how the right data and technology can recharge a marketing plan. – <em>Anna Baskin</em></p>
