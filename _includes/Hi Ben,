Hi Ben, 

Good News! I found the copy from the old website. That will give us enough to get started with. 

Here is some good, draft starter copy (below) for each of the pages:

The only page I don’t have any information/ copy for is the Connected Traveler Page. You know what those ads do, of course. I just need to write copy.

(OVERVIEW)

LOCATION-BASED MARKETING TECHNOLOGY

ARRIVALIST IS A PATENT-PENDING MOBILE MARKETING PLATFORM THAT USES THE INCREASING MOBILITY OF COMPUTING DEVICES TO DO TWO THINGS THAT WERE NOT POSSIBLE BEFORE: 

1)Target ads to a user on her mobile device/s based on the knowledge that they are in a market other than their home market.
2)Empower Destination Marketers to "close the loop" on their marketing spend by seeing which ads are more likely to result in actual arrivals in market.
Arrivalist works with both industry-leading Destination Marketers
and Marketers that wish to target travelers who are on the road, but still online – the connected traveler.

Our advertising technology gives marketers ground-breaking reporting and unique new ways to deliver ads to the travelers who spend more than $855 billion*/year while on the road. (*source: US Travel Assn.)

PRESENCE = ROI

The Arrivalist Marketing Platform is one of the first technologies to directly measure offline response to online advertising.

Monitoring how many people show up in a particular market after being exposed to tourism-related media that promotes that market, gives Arrivalist and its clients unique insights into the what we call "the way media moves us."

Use the Contact Us button to find out how we can utilize our technology and insights to give you research into how your customers are likely to respond, offline, to ads that they've been exposed to online.
